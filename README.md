### Project Description
ProcrastiMATE is a satirical anti-productivity app that rewards users for procrastinating. Instead of helping you get things done, it tracks how long you avoid tasks and celebrates your delays with pointless badges, fake coins, and AI-generated excuses. It‚Äôs the only timer that cheers when you do absolutely nothing.


### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
In a world obsessed with hustle, motivation, and getting things done, there's zero support for people who just want to chill. No app celebrates the art of doing nothing, delaying everything, and embracing glorious laziness. Productivity tools are everywhere ‚Äî but where‚Äôs the love for procrastinators?


### The Solution (that nobody asked for)


I didn‚Äôt want to be productive. I just wanted to scroll, snack, and snooze ‚Äî and finally, there‚Äôs an app that gets me.

So I created ProcrastiMATE: the anti-productivity app made only for me... and accidentally perfect for everyone else.

I get rewarded for not doing things.
I earn Delay Score‚Ñ¢ points for avoiding tasks.
I add tasks to my Anti-To-Do List ‚Äî then do absolutely nothing about them.
I shake my phone and get an excuse for my professor, boss, or mom.
And when I‚Äôm dangerously close to doing something useful, I hit the Emergency Distraction Button.

This isn‚Äôt self-help. This is self-halt.

Because sometimes, doing nothing feels like everything.
