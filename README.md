### Project Description
ProcrastiMATE is a satirical anti-productivity app that rewards users for procrastinating. Instead of helping you get things done, it tracks how long you avoid tasks and celebrates your delays with pointless badges, fake coins, and AI-generated excuses. It’s the only timer that cheers when you do absolutely nothing.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
In a world obsessed with hustle, motivation, and getting things done, there's zero support for people who just want to chill. No app celebrates the art of doing nothing, delaying everything, and embracing glorious laziness. Productivity tools are everywhere — but where’s the love for procrastinators?


### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
I didn’t want to be productive. I just wanted to scroll, snack, and snooze — and finally, there’s an app that gets me.

So I created ProcrastiMATE: the anti-productivity app made only for me... and accidentally perfect for everyone else.

I get rewarded for not doing things.
I earn Delay Score™ points for avoiding tasks.
I add tasks to my Anti-To-Do List — then do absolutely nothing about them.
I shake my phone and get an excuse for my professor, boss, or mom.
And when I’m dangerously close to doing something useful, I hit the Emergency Distraction Button.

This isn’t self-help. This is self-halt.

Because sometimes, doing nothing feels like everything.
